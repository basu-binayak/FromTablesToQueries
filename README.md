# 📘 FromTablesToQueries

**FromTablesToQueries** is a Jupyter Book focused on teaching SQL through relational thinking rather than rote syntax. It explains how data is stored in tables, how relationships are formed, and how queries are executed to produce results.

The book uses **SQL Server (T-SQL)** and **PostgreSQL** as primary databases, highlighting both shared SQL fundamentals and engine-specific behavior.
